# EezybotMK1ComputerVision

This project aims to use the open source robot manipulator EEZYbot MK1 of daGHIZmo with computer vision. A first part will be conducted in order to simply manipulate it with a joystick and then we will add the computer vision so that to end effector can follow an object.

## Inverse Kinematic

The inverse kinematic allows to manipulate of robot for (x,y) coordinates. For a position you have to calculate the joints angles that your robot needs to have in order to reach that position, that what the equation of the inverse kinematic translates. For now the inverse kinematic used in the one describe here https://github.com/jamesthesken/eezy-control
